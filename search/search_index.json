Throughput and latencies for each benchmark are measured, as are resource statistics during the benchmark process. The Smart Contract All benchmarks are facilitated by the fixed-asset smart contract that is deployed to the Hyperledger Fabric network. The smart contract facilitates the driving of core API methods that are commonly used by a smart contract developer. Smart Contract Method Description emptyContract Immediately returns an empty response and represents the minimum possible overhead incurred through evaluation or submission of a smart contract method via a gateway. createAsset Performs a single putState() operation, inserting an asset of defined byte size into the World State database. createAssetsFromBatch Performs multiple putState() operations over an array of assets, inserting each into the World State database. getAsset Performs a single getState() operation, extracting and returning a single asset from the World State database using a passed UUID. getAssetsFromBatch Performs multiples getState() operations over an array of asset UUIDs, extracting and returning all asset from the World State database. paginatedRangeQuery Performs a getStateByRangeWithPagination() operation, based on passed start/end keys, a desired page size and passed bookmark. The records obtained from the query are processed and returned in a JSON response that also includes a new bookmark. paginatedRichQuery Performs a getQueryResultWithPagination() operation, based on a passed Mango query string, a desired page size and bookmark. The records obtained from the query are processed and returned in a JSON response that also includes a new bookmark. Only valid for deployments including a CouchDB World State database. Smart contract methods may be evaluated or submitted via a Fabric Network gateway. An overview of possible transaction pathways from a client application interacting with Hyperedger Fabric is presented in Figure 1. Evaluation of a smart contract method will not include interaction with the ordering service, and consequently will not result in appending to the leger; submission of a smart contract will result on the method being run on Hyperledger Fabric Peers as required by the endorsement policy and appended to the ledger by the ordering service. Figure 1: Possible Transaction Pathways Smart Contract Benchmarks The complete output of the benchmark runs, and the resources used to perform them, are in the resources section of the Appendix. All benchmarks are driven at maximum possible TPS for a duration of 5 minutes by multiple test clients.
